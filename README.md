This is a Rails 5 / Ruby 2.2.2 app that uses the Twitter API to retrieve the last 25 tweets for any given Twitter handle.

Devise was used for the authentication layer and the Twitter gem was used as the interface for the Twitter API.

The Twitter keys were kept as local Environment variables and subsequently as Config variables on Heroku.

For time constraints, the views were kept basic with styling from Bootstrap 3.

Tests were done with RSpec and can be run with the command `bundle exec rspec`
